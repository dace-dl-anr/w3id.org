## Overview

The CODIT (Core Ontology for Data Interlinking Tools) ontology provides a structured framework for describing and categorizing various aspects of data interlinking tools. It is designed to capture the core concepts, properties, and relationships involved in the data interlinking process, supporting interoperability and comparative evaluation among tools. CODIT covers linking tools, techniques, data formats, and related features, making it suitable for data interlinking applications.

## Usage

The CODIT ontology is intended for researchers, developers, and users working on data interlinking tools. It enables:
- **Tool Documentation**: Providing a standardized framework for documenting data linking tools and their functionalities.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Supporting comparative studies by detailing tool-specific features, linking techniques, input/output data, and evaluation metrics.
- **Interoperability**: Facilitating interoperability among tools by standardizing the representation of linking techniques, data types, and output formats.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to expand and refine the CODIT ontology. Contributions may include additional linking techniques, performance metrics, domain-specific applications, or feedback to enhance its usability and coverage. Please submit pull requests or open issues in this repository to discuss your ideas and suggestions.
